Frontend
--------

The frontend consists of 1 textbox that takes either English or Romanized text as input.
The current word is sent to the backend, which returns a list of word objects that match 
the current word. The user selects from the options and the selected word is added to a 
running list of words to be returned.

If a user uses backspace, the last japanese word in the text box is deleted and the word object
is removed from the list of words to be returned.

On submit, the list of word objects is sent to the backend.
